# VizChemoton - Visualization of Reaction Networks Generated with Chemoton

This package allows the **visualization of chemical reaction networks (CRNs)** generated with [Chemoton](https://github.com/qcscine/chemoton) 
through the generation of standalone HTML files with the [amk-tools](https://github.com/dgarayr/amk_tools),ultimately allowing the user to interact 
with the network **just via browser**.

*The image above shows which type of visualization (network on the left, structure on 
the right) the HTML file permits*

## Introduction to Chemoton

The research group of Markus Reiher at ETH Zürich has developed the software enviroment [SCINE](https://github.com/qcscine) ("Software for Chemical Interaction Networks")[1] which pursues the performance of quantum chemical calculations with special focus on algorithmic stability, automation, interactivity, efficiency and error control. In this context, Chemoton is the SCINE module in charge of exploring CRNs in a fully automated fashion based on first-principles.[2] 

The reaction network results from Chemoton can be visualized with the graphical user interface developed in the same SCINE framework, named [Heron](https://github.com/qcscine/heron).[3] This GUI has many functionalities beyond visualization, such as monitoring and steering the exploration, as well as creating json files to make the whole process reproducible. 

> Here we offer a complementary visualization tool aimed at providing an interactive visualization of the CRN without any previous dependencies. We highlight, however, that *VizChemoton* is just meant for creating a light-weight and convenient visualization format of the CRN, thus making it easily accessible to the scientific community.     


## Introduction to amk-tools

The research group of Carles Bo at ICIQ (Tarragona, Spain) developed a library, named *amk-tools* allowing the reading,[4] processing and visualizing the reaction networks generated by [AutoMeKin](https://github.com/emartineznunez/AutoMeKin), an automated reaction discovery program developed by Emilio Martinez Nuñez (Galicia, Spain).[5] 


> Here we tailor the application of *amk-tools* to the visualization of CRNs generated with *Chemoton*. 


## Code overview

In the following diagram we describe the modules that VizChemoton
uses to generate the html file.
The full workflow starts from querying the Mongo-DB *(1)* using the SCINE modules *(2)* to obtain the reactions
and compounds of the reaction network. Because querying the Mongo-DB might be a time-consuming step, we 
have enabled the option to export the network as a json file, so that for future runs, the network can 
be directly imported *(a)*. The reaction and compounds data are also stored in a csv and json file respectively 
*(b)*. This allows importing the reaction and compound data without querying Mongo-DB nor the 
SCINE dependencies. To generate the visualization of the network, the amk-tools is called *(4)* which ultimately
writes the html file *(5)*.

Notice that the chemical data present in the network.html can also be converted into pairs of input-ouput files
using [json2orca](https://github.com/gruberlopez/json2orca) *(c)* so that the date can be uploaded in the FAIR repository
[ioChem-BD](https://www.iochem-bd.org/) *(d)*. In section [5](#references) we show how network.html and data in 
ioChem-BD complement each other.

|----------------------|---------|
| python               | 3.6.x   |
| amktools             | x.x.x   |
| nodejs               | 14.0.0  |
| scine-database       | 1.4.0   |
| scine-heron          | 1.0.0   |

## Installation 

Here we provide a short installation guide for VizChemoton based on using an anaconda environment (e.g., my_env).

```bash

# Create a conda enviroment
conda create --name my_env python=3.6
conda activate my_env
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14

# Install Chemoton
git clone https://github.com/qcscine/chemoton.git
cd chemoton
git checkout 3.1.0
# make sure python3 from my_env is called
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install .
cd ..

# Install amk-tools
git clone https://gitlab.com/dgarayr/amk_tools.git
python3 -m pip install -e ./amk_tools/

# Install VizChemoton
git clone https://github.com/petrusen/vizchemoton.git
python3 -m pip install -r ./vizchemoton/requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install ./vizchemoton

```

## Example

Before running the code, the user must specify the location of the Mongo-DB (ip, port and name) and 
the exploration parameters (method, basis set ...). Moreover, the 

```bash

# Edit the main file
vi ./vizchemoton/__main__.py

# Run the code of this repository to obtain the html
python3 -m viz_chemoton.py 

```

The code render an html file, with the path and name specified by the user, which contains the compounds and 
reactions of the reaction network. 

### Usage of the HTML File
